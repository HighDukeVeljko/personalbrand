In the heart of shadows, where struggles reside, 
A tale of pain and grit, where hopes collide, 
Mine will hate strep, trapped in a blackened box, 
Yet the spirit endures, defying the locks. 
Sin's grip, like shackles, held tight in its snare, 
Yearning for a golden chain, a time fairer, 
But in the town of crows, on the up-town street, 
In the humble abode's embrace, life's rhythm beat. 
Wearing the belly of the beast, hunger's plight, 
Greed for the cheap, the struggle's fight, 
From one sin, now 3.6, the weight we bear, 
In this labyrinth of life, a complex snare. 
Earning strips of survival, paying death's toll, 
On streets where bullets sing, taking their toll, 
A day's name etched in blood and despair, 
A chilling legacy, a world stripped bare. 
B-dogs forged by hits, a story unfolds, 
Marked by the scars where destiny molds, 
During pain, a strength to find, 
A resilience rich, a spirit unconfined. 
How have we endured, and thrived upon this floor, 
Where death's specter lingers, yet we seek more, 
A place where struggle doesn't stop? We stand, 
In the face of trials, a united band. 
Amid the darkness, a spark will glow, 
Through trials and tribulations, we'll grow, 
In this concrete realm, we've learned to cope, 
The struggle won't cease as long as we hope.
